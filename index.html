<H1 class="About1-title"> Welcome to Beyond dark matter!</H1>
<p class="about-info">
This is the space where I’ll be exploring concepts and questions in astrophysics that interest me, from dark black holes to white holes, and questions such as ‘are black holes really black? ‘ and could something like a ‘rainbow hole‘ exist?. Nevermind.
</p>
<p class="about-info2"> Anyways, I am super excited to research (although, I'm not the best at it) and learn about the key concepts, some of the popular ones being the big bang theory, dark matter, and dark energy. Now I know these terms sound weird (like super weird) But honestly, trust me they are INTRESTING. That said, see u later!</p>
